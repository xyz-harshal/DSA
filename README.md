# DSA

This repository is dedicated to **Binary Search** algorithms in C++.

## Structure

- **binarySearch/**: Contains implementations of various binary search techniques for finding elements, counting occurrences and solving array-based problems.

## Implementations

1. **Basic Binary Search** (`binarySearch.cpp`): Finds the index of a target element in a sorted array.
2. **First & Last Occurrence**: Locates the first and last positions of a target in a sorted array, useful for counting occurrences.
3. **Peak Index in a Mountain Array**: Solves LeetCode #852 by identifying the peak in a mountain-shaped array.

## Usage

To run any of these files:
```bash
g++ binarySearch.cpp -o binarySearch
./binarySearch
```
